Selene Media Encoder
=======================

What is Selene?
------------------
Selene is an audio/video converter for linux.
The encoding is done using simple bash scripts that contain
commands for converting the input file. Selene acts as a GUI wrapper for these 
bash scripts. You can use any command line tool for encoding your videos and
Selene will display the progress information along with options to pause/resume/shutdown, etc. 

How does it work?
------------------
Simply drag audio/video files to the main window, select the encoding script
from the drop-down and click 'Start' to begin. The progress window will display
the completion percentage for each file along with options to pause/resume 
encoding.

Running the app in admin mode (using sudo or gksu) will enable additional GUI
options. The progress window will display two additional buttons; one for
shutting down the system after encoding, and another for running the conversion 
process with a lower priority (background-mode).

What kind of scripts are used for conversion?
-----------------------------------------------
The scripts are ordinary bash scripts.
The simplest script would be:

x264 -o "${outDir}/${title}.mkv" "${inFile}"

This script converts any given input file to an MKV file using the x264 encoder. 

${inFile}, ${outDir}, ${title} are variables which refer to the input file. 
The value of these variables will be inserted into the script before execution. 
It is mandatory to use these variables instead of hard-coding the input file 
names. This is the only restriction.

The script can use **any** command line tool for converting the files. There is no 
restriction whatsoever. The progress percentage will be calculated automatically
from the console output of the encoding tool.

If the encoding tool is a common tool (like ffmpeg or x264), 
selene will provide some additional features:
* The console output displayed in the statusbar will be pretty-formatted
* The input files can be auto-cropped by replacing the cropping parameters 
specified in the script

How does auto-cropping work?
-----------------------------------------------
For auto-cropping the input files:
1) Select one or more files from the input list
2) Right-click and select the AutoCrop option. This will calculate the cropping
parameters for the file.
3) Select any script that uses avconv, x264 or ffmpeg2theora for encoding. The
script must use the cropping option for the encoder that is used. For example,
we can use: x264 --vf crop:0,0,0,0 -o "${outDir}/${title}.mkv" "${inFile}"
The cropping values specified in the script will be replaced with the calculated
values before the script is executed.

After using the 'AutoCrop' option, the output can be previewed by right-clicking 
the file and selecting the 'Preview Output' option. The calculated values can
be edited directly from the input file list. Clear the values to disable the
cropping option.

Why can't I just run the bash script from a terminal window?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You can. The scripts can be used independantly for encoding your videos.
But using Selene will give you the following additional options:

* The scripts are easier to write since Selene automatically inserts commonly 
  required variables into the script
* A batch of files can be selected and encoded with the selected script
* Pause/Resume options
* Shutdown PC after encoding
* Run the processes with low priority
* Option to set the output location
* Option to move the input files to a backup location after encoding

You can also use Selene as a normal command line application.
Run Selene with the '--help' argument to see the full list of options.

What are the variables that are inserted into the scripts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The following variables will be inserted into the script before execution:
inFile, name, title, ext, subFile, subName, subExt, tempDir, inDir, outDir

subFile, subName and subExt variables will be set if any SRT, SSA, ASS files
are found in the input folder. The subtitle files must begin with the same name
as the input file and must be present in the same directory.

What additional features are available for creating scripts?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
See the README file in the scripts folder for the full list of options.
