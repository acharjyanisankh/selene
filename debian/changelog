selene (2.6.1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Fixed: If framerate is fractional, then audio-video is out-of-sync for H264 video

  * Fixed: Incorrect icon was displayed for 'About' button on toolbar

  * Fixed: Input file properties were not parsed correctly for some files. These files would give a 'format not supported' error when added to the input list
  
  * Perf: Query only required properties when reading file info from disk
  
  * Added list of 3rd party tools to the About\Credits dialog
