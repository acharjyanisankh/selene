Conversion Scripts
================================================================================

 * Scripts will be read from this directory. The script files must have a ".sh"
   extension.

 * The scripts placed here are normal bash scripts. Any encoder can be used in
   the script for converting the input files.
   
 * Some additional options will be available if the following encoders are used:
   avconv, ffmpeg, ffmpeg2theora, x264, mkvmerge

 * While creating new scripts, please use the following variables instead of using
   fixed values. These variables will be inserted into the script before execution.

   inFile, name, title, ext, subFile, subName, subExt, tempDir, inDir, outDir

 * subFile, subName and subExt variables will be set if any SRT, SSA, ASS files
   are found in the input folder. The subtitle files must begin with the same name
   as the input file and must be present in the same directory.

 * Some special macros are available for common tasks.
   These macros will be replaced before the script is executed.

   ${audiodec} - Decode and pipe the audio stream in ${inFile}

   Example:
   ${audiodec} | <encoder>

   This is equivalent to:
   avconv -i "${inFile}" -f wav -acodec pcm_s16le -vn -y - | <encoder>
